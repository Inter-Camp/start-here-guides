## Contributing
First off, thank you for considering contributing to InterCamp. It's people like you that make InterCamp such a great app.

### Where do I go from here?
If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, make one! It's generally best if you get confirmation of your bug or approval for your feature request this way before starting to code.

Label the issue with [bug], [good first issue], [feature] ect.

### Fork & create a branch
If this is something you think you can fix, then fork [Inter-Camp](https://github.com/Inter-Camp/InterCamp) and create a branch with a descriptive name.

### A good branch name would be (where issue #325 is the ticket you're working on):

`` git checkout -b 325-add-japanese-translations ``
